# 🕌 PraySync

Welcome to the PraySync project repository.  
This project is a unified system for managing and serving Salah (prayer) and Azan times for multiple mosques.  
It is designed to provide clean access to prayer schedules through time-aware queries and mosque-wise data organization.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system enables real-time retrieval of prayer times based on mosque name or time context.  
It is built for integration with mobile apps, IoT devices, or public displays and focuses on structured data storage, accurate calculations, and scalable mosque support.
